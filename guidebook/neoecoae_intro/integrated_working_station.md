The <ItemLink id="neoecoae:integrated_working_station" /> is an advanced crafting machine that combines multiple AE2 device functions into a single, powerful workstation. It is essential for crafting most of the advanced components in this mod.

## Features

- **9 Input Slots** - Supports up to 9 different input items
- **Fluid Input/Output** - Supports fluid ingredients and outputs (16,000 mB capacity each)
- **Energy Powered** - Consumes FE (Forge Energy) for crafting
- **ME Network Integration** - Connects to your AE2 network for power supply
- **Auto Export** - Can automatically export finished products
- **Upgrade Support** - Supports AE2 speed upgrades to accelerate crafting

## Crafting

The Integrated Working Station is crafted using components from various AE2 machines:

## Usage

1. **Place the station** and connect it to your ME Network
2. **Input materials** - Place items in the 9 input slots and/or fill the fluid input tank
3. **Provide power** - Ensure sufficient FE is available (from ME Network or external sources)
4. **Wait for processing** - The station will automatically process when requirements are met
5. **Collect output** - Retrieve finished items from the output slot or enable auto-export

### ECO Cell Components

All ECO storage cell components (16MB, 64MB, 256MB) are crafted using the Integrated Working Station.

### ECO Computation Cells

Computation cells for the ECO Computation System are also crafted here.

### Multiblock Controllers

The controllers for all three ECO multiblock systems (Storage, Computation, Crafting) are crafted using this station.

## Tips

- Use Speed Upgrades to significantly reduce processing time
- Connect to a Dense Energy Cell or high-capacity power source for uninterrupted crafting
- Enable Auto Export when batch processing to automatically push outputs to adjacent inventories
- The station can accept fluids from pipes or fluid cells
