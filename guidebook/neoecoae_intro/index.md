# Neo ECO AE Extension

Welcome to the Neo ECO AE Extension guidebook! This mod adds powerful multiblock machines that extend the capabilities of Applied Energistics 2.

## Multiblock Systems

The mod provides three main categories of multiblock machines:

### Storage System
The [ECO Storage System](storage_system.md) provides massive extensible storage capacity for your ME Network. Features include:
- High-capacity ECO storage cells (16MB, 64MB, 256MB)
- Integrated high-density energy cells
- Three tiers: L4, L6, L9

### Computation System
The [ECO Computation System](computation_system.md) is a powerful crafting CPU cluster that replaces standard AE2 crafting CPUs. Features include:
- Multiple simultaneous crafting threads
- Massive crafting acceleration
- Scalable architecture
- Three tiers: C4, C6, C9

### Crafting System
The [ECO Crafting System](crafting_system.md) is an advanced pattern provider with parallel processing capabilities. Features include:
- High parallelism for pattern execution
- Overclocking support
- Active cooling for enhanced performance
- Three tiers: F4, F6, F9

## Energized Budding Crystal

The [Energized Budding Crystal](energized_crystal.md) is a key material for crafting many components in this mod. Learn how to obtain it through lightning strikes or the Crystal Fixer.

## Integrated Working Station

The [Integrated Working Station](integrated_working_station.md) is an advanced crafting machine that combines multiple AE2 device functions. It is essential for crafting most advanced components including multiblock controllers.

## Getting Started

1. Gather materials and craft the required components for your chosen system
2. Build the multiblock structure according to the system's requirements
3. Right-click the controller to verify the structure is formed correctly
4. Connect the system to your ME Network through the interface block

## Tier System

All multiblock systems use a tiered architecture:
- **Tier 4 (L4/C4/F4)** - Entry level, uncommon rarity
- **Tier 6 (L6/C6/F6)** - Mid tier, rare rarity
- **Tier 9 (L9/C9/F9)** - Top tier, epic rarity

Higher tiers provide increased capacity, speed, and efficiency.
